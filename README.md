# smart-investor-analyzer
This Python application analyzes the stock market and provides investors with useful information for
both immediate and long-term decision-making. The project is prompted by the growing need for
data-based, user-friendly solutions that make financial markets easier to understand. The tool is
helpful for both long-term investors seeking sustainable growth and day traders seeking short-term
forecasts since it integrates technical indicators, fundamental measurements, and economic
elements to allow users to study trends over a variety of timeframes. This project connects to my
dream project idea of developing predictive models for currencies and bonds, which leverage time
series data to uncover relationships between economic indicators and asset prices. Both utilize live
data to make predictions for future market prices.
